# Causmos: Causal Impact for Google Ads & Analytics Reporting

This repository contains a code to automate the collection of data from Google Ads, Google analytics
4 and Google sheets and then run a [Casual Impact](https://github.com/google/tfp-causalimpact) analysis 
with that information.

The solution creates an AppEngine instance and uses the logged in user's credentials to connect
to Google Ads, Google Analytics 4 and Google Sheets.
